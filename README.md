# Stock Analysis
Currently, the application will ask for a stock ticker symbol. Once entered, it graph 2 years worth of historical data using a Yahoo Finance API.

## Dependencies
Matplotlib and Numpy are a _must_. I recommend running the program with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to avoid any issues.

## TODO
- Robinhood stock trading integration
- tkinter GUI
- Graphing volume/time separately
- More graphical analysis!
